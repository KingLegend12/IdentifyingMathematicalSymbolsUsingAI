# IdentifyingMathematicalSymbolsUsingAI

Group members: Driss Jaidi and Mohammed Chaouni
Project: Identifying hand written mathematical symbols using Neural Networks

How to run:

Install Anaconda Navigator

Install Jupyter-notebook inside Anaconda Navigator

Create new file inside Jupyter-notebook

open terminal 

Install Tensorflow and CNN

1-Data Collection: 
Using Kaggle website, our own hannd written symbols, and some of the hasyV2 mathematical math symbols 
data collection is very hard due to the limited number and lack of human ressources to do so

2- Splitting the datasets into training and test sets

3-Training the model more details in the report

4-making predictions of new images
